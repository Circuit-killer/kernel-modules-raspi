%% HW related details:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

GPIO16 to control the led, active low

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Before running the makefile, set the cross-compiler:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

export CCPREFIX=/home/osso/isomount/Linux_tools/raspberry/toolchain/tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi/bin/bcm2708-

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% How to "manually" drive the LEDG0 on the raspi board:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

export PT=/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

echo none > PT

%% turn off/on

echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

%% default

echo mmc0 > PT

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% use a pre-compiled module to drive the led:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

modprobe ledtrig_heartbeat
echo heartbeat > PT
%% the description of the ledtrig_heartbeat module can be found in the kernel sources:
%% linux/drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-heartbeat.c

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% IMPORTANT: 
%% before running your own module driving the led, you MUST 
%% remove any other running module driving the led.
%% In case of raspbian:

rmmod leds_gpio
